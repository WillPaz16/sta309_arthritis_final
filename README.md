# Arthritis Predictions Across Ohio
Predicting the prevalence of arthritis throughout Ohio.

## Dashboard

Create a dashboard that includes visualizations to investigate the relationship between arthritis and each of the following variables:

  * Gender
  * Age
  * Race
  * Daily drinks (i.e., alcohol use)
  * Smoking status
  * Physical activity
    
You must also include 2 additional exploratory plots. These can be anything relevant to the analysis, but here are some suggestions:

  * Relationship between any of the above variables and the different types of arthritis (“MCQ195”).
  * Relationships among any of the above variables, investigating possible sources of confounding.
  * Different types of physical activity and their relationships with arthritis risk.
